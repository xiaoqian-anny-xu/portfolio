                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8 italic">I attended the Plusplusone creative workshop, where I worked on real-life cases for Bol and Ocean Outdoor. Collaborating with my teammates, we <span style="color: #9333ea;">developed creative strategies and ideations</span>, which we presented to the clients. I took the lead in <span style="color: #9333ea;">creating and finetuning the presentation decks</span> and thoroughly enjoyed visualizing our ideas. In the end, I stepped into <span style="color: #9333ea;">the role of director</span> to produce a video based on our insights.

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">Ocean Outdoor, a company specializing in digital billboards and advertising screens, challenged us to identify a subculture in Amsterdam and visually capture their feelings and definition of what it means to be an "Amsterdammer" on digital screens.</p>

                </figure>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">Our team selected the Heesterveld creative community subculture and developed a strategy to showcase their unique cultureâ€”highlighting the home-like environment that fosters active creativity. We then crafted a creative idea based on this strategy.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-purple-600">Our Approach - Strategy</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">My team (Charen, Stanley, Devesh, and I) explored the Heesterveld creative community, a vibrant and artistic neighbourhood in Bijlmer, Amsterdam. I conducted an interview along with Charen, repeatedly analyzed the transcripts, and reviewed social media content to uncover key insights about this community. We discovered that a sense of home and mutual support is crucial for artists to thrive.</p>

                </figure>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">Therefore, our strategy focused on recreating the sense of home and belonging that once defined this community, guiding our approach to strategy and ideation.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">Our team worked closely with Ocean Outdoor to bring our creative strategy to life across various digital billboards in Amsterdam. We implemented a phased approach to roll out different interactive elements and themes.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">The campaign received positive feedback from both Amsterdam residents and visitors. Key outcomes included:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-8">
                    <li>Increased engagement with Ocean Outdoor's digital screens, with an average interaction time of 45 seconds</li>
                    <li>Over 10,000 user-generated content submissions in the first month</li>
