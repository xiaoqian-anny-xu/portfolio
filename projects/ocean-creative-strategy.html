                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8 italic">I attended the Plusplusone creative workshop, where I worked on real-life cases for Bol and Ocean Outdoor. Collaborating with my teammates, we <span style="color: #9333ea;">developed creative strategies and ideations</span>, which we presented to the clients. I took the lead in <span style="color: #9333ea;">creating and finetuning the presentation decks</span> and thoroughly enjoyed visualizing our ideas. In the end, I stepped into <span style="color: #9333ea;">the role of director</span> to produce a video based on our insights.

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">Ocean Outdoor, a company specializing in digital billboards and advertising screens, challenged us to identify a subculture in Amsterdam and visually capture their feelings and definition of what it means to be an "Amsterdammer" on digital screens.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">Our team selected the Heesterveld creative community subculture and developed a strategy to showcase their unique culture—highlighting the home-like environment that fosters active creativity. We then crafted a creative idea based on this strategy.</p>

                 </a>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">My team (Charen, Stanley, Devesh, and I) explored the Heesterveld creative community, a vibrant and artistic neighbourhood in Bijlmer, Amsterdam. I conducted an interview along with Charen, repeatedly analyzed the transcripts, and reviewed social media content to uncover key insights about this community. We discovered that a sense of home and mutual support is crucial for artists to thrive.</p>

                </figure>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">Therefore, our strategy focused on recreating the sense of home and belonging that once defined this community, guiding our approach to strategy and ideation.</p>

                </a>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">After presenting our strategy to the client and receiving feedback, we continued to turn the strategy into actionable ideas. Through brainstorming, we developed the concept of a video that showcases how sweet and warm the creative community is:
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">A typical Amsterdammer encountered an untypical Amsterdammer, and followed her lead into the world of another side of Amsterdam - Heesterveld. He witnesses all kinds of possibilities happening in the community and is warmly welcomed to create and have fun together. In the end, he has a good time and feels at home in this community.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-purple-600">Presentation decks</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">I led the creation of both the strategy and ideation decks. To ensure a cohesive look that aligned with Ocean Outdoor’s brand, I started by selecting a clean and simple Canva template that reflected their style. I then customized the template by finding images and design elements that fit our content, modifying the overall style to communicate our ideas.</p>
